<br><b>Course Description:</b>
</td>
<td align="justify">
<br>
This course aims to provide students with an overview of Artificial Intelligence principles and techniques.
Key topics include machine learning, neural networks, computer vision, reinforcement learning, large language models, etc.
Intended learning outcome:
1. Students will learn to describe key principles, concepts, models and techniques in AI.
2. Students will have a broad understanding of what AI can accomplish today and what cannot
3. Students can implement AI algorithms introduced in class to solve small real-world problems.
4. Students can develop AI solutions to real-world problems through a course project and deliver written and oral presentations.

                <li> The goal of the assignments is to make sure that the fundamentals of AI are understood by all participants.
                </li>
                <li>
                  There are 2 homework assignments over the semester, where you will typically have two weeks' time to work on each. (Tentative credit distribution: 20%/20%)
                </li>
                <li>
                  Submission will be on Kaggle and Canvas.
                </li>
                <li>
                    We will post performance cutoffs for HIGH and OK for Kaggle competitions.
                    There will be a leaderboard for each assignment to encourage trying extra things.
                    Submissions above OK will get full credit.
                    Submissions above HIGH will get an extra 2% credit for each assignment.
                    The grade cutoff will be released 1 week before the DDL so you do not need to “内卷” till the last minute.

                </li>
                <li>
                    Homework assignments and course project results are worth full credit on the due date.
                    This means you need to submit on the leaderboard and on Canvas (usually several days later than the Kaggle DDL) on time.
                    Unless granted an extension in advance, it is worth at most 75% credit for the next 48 hours, at most 50% credit after that.
                    If you need an extension, please ask for it as soon as the need for it is known.
                    Extensions that are requested promptly can be granted more liberally. You must turn in all assignments.
                </li>
                <li>
                   Each homework is an individual assignment. You should not look at others' code.

                  The goal of the course project is to define and perform a small-scale experiment on your own, in order to gain hands-on experience which can then be scaled and generalized to other AI tasks.

                  Can be done in groups, defined at the beginning.

                  <b>The project is a key component of this course. </b>

                  This is also intended to be a "flipped-classroom" experience, where you will have the opportunity to present how you define and solve a problem using AI to the class.
                  The course instructors, the TAs and your peers will provide you with useful feedback.
                </li>
                <li>The project is worth 50% of your grade. These points are
                    distributed as follows:
                    10% - Project Proposal;
                    20% - Project
                    Presentation (midterm and final);
                    20% - Project report. The grading rubrics will be described in the lecture.

                  The attendance is worth 10%, which will be based on the three project presentation attendance and some other secret observations.

                <li>

                Final grade example: If you attend most of the lectures, have 2 OKs for the assignments and do a decent job in the project, you should get a grade of no less than A. (This means you have fulfilled the requirements of this course and achieved the intended learning outcome.). Having missed one assignment, you can only get at most B.

<b>Collaboration among Students:</b>
</td>
<td align="justify">
We encourage collaboration between students and studying materials in groups when the purpose of this is to facilitate learning, not to circumvent problems. It is allowed to seek help from other students in understanding the material needed to solve a particular problem. However, students must submit individual material and solutions, unless otherwise specified. Students should declare any collaboration on the first page of homework assignments (or equivalently on exercises). If the instructors believe the collaboration is improper, your grade may be affected. <br><br>
