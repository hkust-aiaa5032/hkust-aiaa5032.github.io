                <li> The goal of the assignments is to make sure that the fundamentals of AI are understood by all participants.
                </li>
                <li>
                  There are 3 homework assignments over the semester, where you will typically have two weeks' time to work on each.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Submission will be on Kaggle and Canvas.
                </li>
                <li> We will post performance cutoffs for
                    <b>
                        HIGH (90%) and OK (50%)
                    </b> for Kaggle competitions.
                    Scores will be interpolated linearly
                    between these cutoffs.
                    There will be a leaderboard for each assignment to encourage trying extra things.
                    Top-3 submissions will get an extra 10% credit for each assignment.
                </li>
                <li> Homework (assignments and quizzes) and term project results are worth full credit on the due date. Unless granted an extension in advance, it is worth at most 75% credit for the next 48 hours, at most 50% credit after that. If you need an extension, please ask for it as soon as the need for it is known. Extensions that are requested promptly can be granted more liberally. You must turn in all assignments.

                <li>
                   Each homework is an individual assignment.

                  The goal of the term project is to define and perform a small-scale experiment on your own, in order to gain hands-on experience which can then be scaled and generalized to other AI tasks.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Can be done in groups, defined at the beginning.

                <li>
                  Topic ideas will be provided, but you can suggest your own (if suitable)
                </li>
                <li>The project is worth 25% of your grade. These points are
                    distributed as follows: 10% - Proposal Report (one-page); 40% - Project
                    Presentation (midterm and final); 50% - Project report.

<b>Collaboration among Students:</b>
</td>
<td align="justify">
We encourage collaboration between students and studying materials in groups when the purpose of this is to facilitate learning, not to circumvent problems. It is allowed to seek help from other students in understanding the material needed to solve a particular problem. However, students must submit individual material and solutions, unless otherwise specified. Students should declare any collaboration on the first page of homework assignments (or equivalently on exercises). If the instructors believe the collaboration is improper, your grade may be affected. <br><br>
