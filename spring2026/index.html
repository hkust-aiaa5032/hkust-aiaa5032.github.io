<br><b>Course Description:</b>
</td>
<td align="justify">
<br>
This course aims to provide students with an overview of Artificial Intelligence principles and techniques.
Key topics include machine learning, neural networks, computer vision, reinforcement learning, large language models, etc.
Intended learning outcome:
1. Students will learn to describe key principles, concepts, models and techniques in AI.
2. Students will have a broad understanding of what AI can accomplish today and what cannot
3. Students can implement AI algorithms introduced in class to solve small real-world problems.
4. Students can develop AI solutions to real-world problems through a course project and deliver written and oral presentations.

                <li> The goal of the assignments is to make sure that the fundamentals of AI are understood by all participants.
                </li>
                <li>
                  There are 2 homework assignments over the semester, where you will typically have two weeks' time to work on each. (Tentative credit distribution: 20%/20%)
                </li>
                <li>
                  Submission will be on Kaggle and Canvas (Code and documents).

                <li>
                    We will post performance cutoffs for HIGH, Good and B+ for Kaggle competitions.
                    There will be a leaderboard for each assignment to encourage trying extra things.
                    Submissions above B+ will get 80% credit.
                    Submissions above Good will get full credit.
                    Submissions above HIGH will get an extra 2% credit for each assignment.
                    Between B+ and Good the grade will be linearly interpolated.
                    The grade cutoff will be released beforehand so you do not need to “内卷” till the last minute. The cutoff might go down if everyone finds it too hard.

                </li>
                <li>
                    Homework assignments and course project results are worth full credit on the due date.
                    This means you need to submit on the leaderboard and on Canvas on time.
                    Unless granted an extension in advance, it is worth at most 75% credit for the next 48 hours, at most 50% credit after that.
                    If you need an extension, please ask for it as soon as the need for it is known.
                    Extensions that are requested promptly can be granted more liberally. You must turn in all assignments.

                   Each homework is an individual assignment. You should not look at others' code.

                  The goal of the course project is to define and perform a small-scale experiment on your own, in order to gain hands-on experience which can then be scaled and generalized to other AI tasks.

                <li>
                  Can be done in groups, defined at the beginning. To ensure fair grading, we will conduct anonymous peer evaluations at the end of the term to assess individual contributions.

                    Your project may relate to research in another class project, provided that instructors of both classes grant consent.

                  This is also intended to be a "flipped-classroom" experience, where you will have the opportunity to present how you define and solve a problem using AI to the class.
                  The course instructors, the TAs and your peers will provide you with useful feedback.
                </li>
                <li>The project is worth 35% of your grade. These points are
                    distributed as follows:
                    10% - Midterm Project
                    Presentation;
                    25% - Final Project
                    Presentation + Project report (5%). The grading rubrics will be released beforehand. The presentation will be rated by the course instructors, the TAs and your peers.

<b>Collaboration among Students:</b>
</td>

We encourage collaboration between students and studying materials in groups when the purpose of this is to facilitate learning, not to circumvent problems. (So you should not copy others’ code!) It is allowed to seek help from other students in understanding the material needed to solve a particular problem. However, students must submit individual material and solutions, unless otherwise specified.  <br><br>
